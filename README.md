To run the examples one must add the folders "rank_adaptive_integrator_for_TTN" and "unconventional_TTN_integrator" via the addpath(...) function from Matlab. Further, one must download and also add 
the tensor toolboxes "tensorlab" and "tensortoolbox". Link to it can be found at:

Tensorlab: https://www.tensorlab.net/#download
Tensortoolbox: https://www.tensortoolbox.org/

After including all folders, one can run the examples by running the scripts:
run_script_magnetisation.m for the Ising model 
main_Henon_Heiles.m for the Henon-Heiles model
